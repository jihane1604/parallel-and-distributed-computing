# Assignment 2

## Questions

### Question 1 (10 points)
Explain how the automated maze explorer works. Your answer should include:
1. The algorithm used by the explorer
2. How it handles getting stuck in loops
3. The backtracking strategy it employs
4. The statistics it provides at the end of exploration

To answer this question:
1. Run the explorer both with and without visualization
2. Observe its behavior in different maze types
3. Analyze the statistics it provides
4. Read the source code in `explorer.py` to understand the implementation details

Your answer should demonstrate a clear understanding of:
- The right-hand rule algorithm
- The loop detection mechanism
- The backtracking strategy
- The performance metrics collected

### Question 2 (30 points)
Modify the main program to run multiple maze explorers simultaneously. This is because we want to find the best route out of the maze. Your solution should:
1. Allow running multiple explorers in parallel
2. Collect and compare statistics from all explorers
3. Display a summary of results showing which explorer performed best

*Hints*:
- To get 20 points, use use multiprocessing.
- To get 30 points, use MPI4Py on multiple machines.
- Use Celery and RabbitMQ to distribute the exploration tasks. You will get full marks plus a bonus.
- Implement a task queue system
- Do not visualize the exploration, just run it in parallel
- Store results for comparison

**To answer this question:** 
1. Study the current explorer implementation
2. Design a parallel execution system
3. Implement task distribution
4. Create a results comparison system

### Question 3 (10 points)
Analyze and compare the performance of different maze explorers on the static maze. Your analysis should:

1. Run multiple explorers (at least 4 ) simultaneously on the static maze
2. Collect and compare the following metrics for each explorer:
   - Total time taken to solve the maze
   - Number of moves made
   - *Optional*:
     - Number of backtrack operations

3. What do you notice regarding the performance of the explorers? Explain the results and the observations you made.

### Question 4 (20 points)
Based on your analysis from Question 3, propose and implement enhancements to the maze explorer to overcome its limitations. Your solution should:

1. Identify and explain the main limitations of the current explorer:

2. Propose specific improvements to the exploration algorithm:

3. Implement at least two of the proposed improvements:

Your answer should include:
1. A detailed explanation of the identified limitations
2. Documentation of your proposed improvements
3. The modified code with clear comments explaining the changes

### Question 5 (20 points)

Compare the performance of your enhanced explorer with the original:
   - Run both versions on the static maze
   - Collect and compare all relevant metrics
   - Create visualizations showing the improvements
   - Document the trade-offs of your enhancements
Your answer should include:
1. Performance comparison results and analysis
2. Discussion of any trade-offs or new limitations introduced

### Final points 6 (10 points)
1. Solve the static maze in 150 moves or less to get 10 points.
2. Solve the static maze in 135 moves or less to get 15 points.
3. Solve the static maze in 130 moves or less to get 100% in your assignment.

### Bonus points
1. Fastest solver to get top  10% routes (number of moves)
2. Finding a solution with no backtrack operations
3. Least number of moves.
