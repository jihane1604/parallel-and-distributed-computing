# Lab 1 : Git and SSH Key Integration

## Objectives
- Generate an SSH key on an Ubuntu VM.
- Add the SSH key to your GitHub account.
- Create a GitHub repository and clone it to your VM.
- Set up a basic folder structure for a Python project.
- Perform Git operations such as committing, branching, and pushing changes.

## Steps Performed
1. **SSH Key Creation:**
   - Generated an SSH key using the default file location.
   - Copied the public key and added it to GitHub under SSH/GPG Keys.
2. **Repository Setup:**
   - Created a new repository on GitHub called 'parallel-and-distributed-computing'.
   - Cloned the repository onto the Ubuntu VM.
3. **Project Structure Initialization:**
   - Set up a folder structure including folders for source code (`src/`), tests (`tests/`), and supporting files (`README.md`, `requirements.txt`).
4. **Git Operations:**
   - Committed the initial changes on the master branch.
   - Created a feature branch for new development.
   - Committed incremental changes (e.g., adding `src/main.py`) and pushed them to GitHub.
